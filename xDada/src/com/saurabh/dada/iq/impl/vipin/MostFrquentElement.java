 * Given an unsorted array of natural numbers. Where numbers repeat in array. 
 * Out put numbers in the order of frequency. Where number of out put is passed as parameter. 
		For Ex: 
		Array -> [0, 0, 100, 3, 5, 4, 6, 4, 2, 100, 2, 100] 
		n -> 2 
		Out put -> [100, 0] or [100, 2] 
 * Since 100 is repeated 3 times and 0, 2 is repeated 2 times, out put up to 2 most frequent elements, 
 * program should out put either 100, 0 or 100, 2
